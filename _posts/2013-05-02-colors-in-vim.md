Today at work I sat down to create a small automatic pull-deploy shell script. 
I fired up vim on a development server and nearly had my eyes torn out.
The default theme for vim is bad, well at least I do not like the way that you cannot see comments (dark blue on a black background does not really work).

At home my `.vimrc` sets up my colorscheme, but I could not remember which I tend to use. 
I tried to seach online for some proper screenshots of the differnt themes in vim, but could not find any good comparison/gallery.

That is why I decided to make a bunch of screenshots of vim themes sporting different code snippets.

The reason to do screenshots of different languages as well as the themes were that as I made the first batch of bash screenshots I opened a JavaScript file.
It was totally different to look at, so I opned a ruby file, and a CSS file.
All varied to some degree so I decided to create a bunch of extra screenshots.
