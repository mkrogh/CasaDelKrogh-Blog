A mate and I are planning a trip to Dahab (Egypt) in late March. 

We stumbled upon an offer from kilroy travels where you could get 7 days in Dahab, including a PADI Open Water certification for about [3700 dkk](https://www.google.dk/search?q=3700+dkk+in+usd). This was a nice offer, and all we had to do was book the flight. Well at least so we thought.

After we bought the tickets from Copenhagen to Sharm El Sheikh, we recieved an offer from kilroy for diving in Sharm El Sheikh, not Dahab, and it was suddenly [4600 dkk](https://www.google.dk/search?q=4600+dkk+in+usd) rather than the aforementioned 3700 dkk.

When we recieved this "offer" we were a bit perplexed. 
When we looked at [kilroy.dk](http://www.kilroy.dk/) the offer on Diving in Dahab was gone.
This made us a bit uneasy and we wrote to the travelagent that had sent us the offer.
It turned out that the Dive center in Dahab with wich they had an agreement was undergoing rennovations, and the travel agent then had assumed that we then rather would like to dive in Sharm El Sheikh. 

This was not what we had anticipated.. 
We had already booked the flight ourselves, and planned the time off for the holiday, so we decided to take a look at booking diving and hotel in Dahab ourselves.
