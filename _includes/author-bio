My name is {{ site.author.name }} and I am a software developer at <a href="http://www.nordu.net/" title="NORDUnet">NORDUnet</a>. In my spare time I like to play around with web technologies. I am an avid beliver of dynamic languages, and I am thrilled by the revival of JavaScript along with HTML5.
